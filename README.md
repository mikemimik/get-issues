# get-issues

If you're in the 🌳🌲🌳🌲🌳🌲🌳🌲 without a cell signal, hanging out with some grizzly 🐻 -- it might be helpful to have your github issues available locally on your laptop.

Install globally from npm with:

`npm install get-issues -g`

Run in any directory to get all open github issues available locally.

Works best if you view with markdown plugin or markdown viewer because the contents from github are exported with markdown syntax included!

npm: [npmjs.com/package/get-issues](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-issues)


✅ works with public github repos
✅ works with private repos with Github's access tokens
❎ will soon work with github's 2-factor-authentication
✅ works with ssh or https remote github URLs
✅ works great when used in conjunction with `npm scripts`, using a `post-install` script
