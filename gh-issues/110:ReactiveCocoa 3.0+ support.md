I'd love to be able to use Overcoat with ReactiveCocoa Swift, are there any plans for the support?

Hi @startupthekid, I don't really use ReactiveCocoa, but I would try to add it to Overcoat. 
You're welcome to submit a PR for this too. :smile:

Overcoat already comes with RC as a submodule doesn't it? And maybe I will ;)

yup, but it was added by original project owner. 
I'm new owner since this summer. :)

But as you say, Overcoat has supported old version already, so it should not be too hard to convert it.
